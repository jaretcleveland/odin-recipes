    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe was created to mimic the quality of pizza found in New York
        City. The recipe relies on only a few quality ingredients and a bit of 
        patience. Making the dough from scratch takes time, we want at least 24 
        but idealy 48 to ferment our dough before baking. It is required that 
        you have a baking steel to follow this recipe.

        <li>Remove everything from the bowl onto a large work surface and kneed the dough for 7-8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Ball up the dough and let rest covered for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 20 minutes, strech and fold the dough from each side. Reapeat this step until the dough passes the window pane test.</li>
        <li>Portion the dough into prefered sizes, tightly ball each portion up and place into a lighlty oil container.</li>
        <li>Let ferment in refrigerator for 48-72 hours.</li>

    <h3>Steps making pizza sauce:</h3>

        <li>Add one table spoon of salt (for a 32 oz can of tomatoes)</li>

    <h3>Steps for baking the pizza:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>3-4 hours before baking, remove pizza dough(s) from the refrigerator and let them rest at room temp.</li>
        <li>Preheat you over to its highest temp on convection setting, at least 1 hour prior to baking. This allows you baking steel to heat up.</li>
        <li>"Opening up" your pizza dough can be hard to explain. Follow this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f9-xTcKzZo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> to do so.</li>
        <li>Spoon on some sauce and evenly distribute it over the dough without adding too much. Remember, you can always add more.</li>
        <li>Freshly grade you mozzarella cheese onto the pie. Again, not too much. New York Style pizza should be relatively thin.</li>
